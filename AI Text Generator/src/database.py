This script will create my database
and the table. Furthermore, I will 
have functions in this script to work with 
the database.

Database Schema:
Table essays:
RowID -> Int, Primary Key (Surrogate Key)
Prompt -> VarChar(250), the essay prompts, can be empty.
Essay -> VarChar(10000), the essay
WordCount -> Int, how many words are in the essay.
Generated -> Int, 0 or 1 depending on if the essay was written by a student or an LLM
